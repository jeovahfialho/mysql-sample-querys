We have prepared a simple exercise to better understand how you approach problem-solving, creative thinking, and attention to detail. Every candidate reaching this stage has a maximum of 5 days to deliver the final result.

Donâ€™t worry! This exercise does not take 5 days to complete, not even close. But that will give you plenty of time to work on the solution and deliver it once you are 100% happy with it.

Deliverables: Please send a separate file with your queries and functions for each section below, as well as any outputs of your work. Provide all files organized under a zipped folder.
